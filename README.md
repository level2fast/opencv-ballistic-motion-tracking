# opencv-ballistic-motion-tracking
Ballistic Motion Tracker sample project that uses OpenCV to detect and track a projectile in a video, estimate its trajectory, and apply basic physics to calculate its speed, height, and acceleration.

Setup
--
You’ll need:
- A camera to capture the projectile’s motion.
- OpenCV for c++ installed.
- A simple background to help with object detection, or you can use a specific color or marker on the ball for tracking.
  
Steps
-- 

2. Capture Video
First, capture the video of the projectile’s motion. Ideally, you should have a video of the ball being thrown or launched at a consistent angle with clear lighting conditions.

3. Ball Detection
You can use color-based tracking if the projectile has a unique color or use shape-based detection if it’s spherical

4. Calculate Trajectory
Using the position data from each frame, you can calculate the ballistic trajectory. In the ideal case, the projectile's motion follows a parabolic path, and you can use basic kinematic equations.

5. Calculate Speed and Acceleration
To calculate the speed and acceleration of the projectile, you can take the first and second derivatives of position (displacement):

Speed: The magnitude of the velocity vector.

Acceleration: The rate of change of velocity.

6. Estimate Maximum Height and Range
From the fitted parabolic trajectory, you can estimate the maximum height and the range (distance traveled horizontally before hitting the ground).

7. Visualize Results
You can visualize the trajectory and other physics results by plotting the projectile’s motion
